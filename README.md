# Overview of the project 

## Purpose

The head of the Earthquake Disaster Response Team (EDRT) wanted to develop a website that would allow users to easily see recent earthquake activity and learn additional details about the quakes.

The purpose of this project was to develop interactive mapping that visualizes earthquake data from the last week.  Additionally, tectonic plates are shown to help visitors see their relationship to earthquakes.

I was assigned a mentor and she walked me through the process of creating the website.  After developing the initial maps, I customized additional features and options for the website.

# Results

## Website

When the website initially loads, all earthquakes from the last week are shown.  This data is obtained from the United States Geological Survey and is updated each time the website is loaded.  The tectonic plates are also displayed allowing users to see the high proportion of quakes near the plates.  

The size of the marker for each event varies based upon the magnitude of the earthquake.  The stronger the earthquake, the larger the circle.  Additionally, each marker is color coded to indicate the magnitude and the legend at the bottom right allows users to compare various magnitudes.  The stronger the earthquake, the darker the color.

## Interactivity

The map is able to be dragged and moved.  Users can zoom in or out using multiple methods.  These include clicking, scrolling their mouse wheel, pressing + and â€“ on the keyboard, and using the buttons at the top left of the page.

The image below shows earthquakes in northwestern California after zooming in several levels.

Using the controls in the upper right, the user can switch between styles of maps depending upon their desired view. Users can choose from the default streets map, a night map, or a satellite view.

Users can also disable or reenable the optional components:

* Major earthquakes (4.5+ magnitude) from the last week.  (Note, the markers for the major earthquakes are shown in varying shades of purple from lighter to darker.)

* All earthquakes from the last week

* Tectonic plates

The image below shows the satellite map with only major earthquakes and tectonic plates for northwestern California.

Users can click on any of the markers.  The magnitude and location of the quake will be shown in a popup as shown in the image below.

# Summary

It was a pleasure to be involved in this project and help build such a valuable resource for the EDRT.

If desired, I would be happy to work on some additional enhancements to add value to the website.  There are a number of potential enhancements that could be made over time.

* Providing links to additional resources for learning about earthquakes

* Providing text on the page to highlight the various interactivity and features of the site.

* Adding additional details to the popup - Information available includes the date and time of the earthquake, how many reports were received from people who felt the earthquake, and a value estimating how significant the event was.  Details of the available data can be found at the USGS website https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/comcat/index.php#event-terms
